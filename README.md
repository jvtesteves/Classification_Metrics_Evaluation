# Classification Metrics Evaluation Notebook

This repository contains a Google Colab Notebook for evaluating classification models using common evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity, Precision, and F1-score. The notebook demonstrates how to calculate these metrics using an arbitrarily chosen confusion matrix, and it provides detailed explanations along with the Python code implementation.

## Overview

In classification tasks, a confusion matrix is used to summarize the performance of a model by comparing the actual and predicted labels. This notebook uses a sample confusion matrix to calculate several evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: Measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
- **Specificity**: Measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of predicted positives that are actually positive.
- **F-score (F1-score)**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Sensitivity, providing a balanced metric.

The notebook explains each metric and implements the formulas using Python code.

## Features

- **Clear Explanations**: Detailed Markdown sections explain the concept behind each metric.
- **Simple Python Implementation**: Straightforward Python code is used to compute and display the evaluation metrics.
- **Google Colab Compatible**: The notebook is designed to run seamlessly on Google Colab for easy sharing and collaboration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A Google account (to access and run the notebook on Google Colab).
- No additional libraries are required as the notebook uses standard Python functions.

### Instructions

1. Open Google Colab by visiting [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Click on **File** → **Upload notebook** and select the `Classification_Metrics_Evaluation.ipynb` file.
3. Run each cell sequentially to follow the explanations and view the results.

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

- **Introduction**: An overview of the classification metrics and the purpose of the notebook.
- **Confusion Matrix Explanation**: A description of the confusion matrix components (TP, TN, FP, FN) and their roles.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: LaTeX-rendered formulas for Accuracy, Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and F1-score.
- **Python Code Implementation**: Python code that calculates the metrics using an example confusion matrix.
- **Discussion of Results**: An explanation of what the calculated metrics indicate about the model's performance.
- **Conclusion**: A summary of the notebook and its practical applications.

## Usage

To use the notebook:

- Modify the values of the confusion matrix (TP, TN, FP, FN) in the Python code cell to match your dataset or model results.
- Run the code cells to recalculate the metrics based on the new values.
- Analyze the printed results to assess the performance of your classification model.
